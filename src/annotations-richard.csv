Prophylactic use of myeloid CSFs (also referred to as hematopoietic growth factors) should be considered for patients in whom the anticipated risk of fever and neutropenia is >20%.,A-II,"Prophylactic use of myeloid CSFs has been shown to reduce the incidence of neutropenic fever in a variety of studies and, in meta-analyses, also was associated with reductions in infection-related mortality and all-cause mortality [290–291].",[290],,,
,,,[291],,,
,,"Authoritative evidence-based guidelines have indicated that clinical benefits from prophylactic CSFs accrue when the risk of neutropenic fever associated with a chemotherapy regimen is >20%, unless the treatment is symptomatic or palliative, in which cases dose reduction is usually appropriate [292–294].",292,"In summary, recommendations 1–3 above identified a number of factors that should influence the clinician when considering primary prophylactic G-CSF for patients scheduled to receive chemotherapy. Each of these factors should be incorporated into an assessment of the overall risk of FN for each patient on an individual, case-by-case basis. Therefore, while there is not a strictly defined threshold above which G-CSF should be used, recent studies confirm that G-CSF has clinical benefits for patients at P20% risk of FN.","Network [NCCN]),43 Canada75 and Europe (EORTC19 ESMO76),
consistently advocate a risk threshold of 20% for routine
G-CSF support in patients with solid tumours and lymphoma.
74 This threshold was established after the results
from two large clinical trials demonstrated substantial reduction
in FN incidence at this level of risk [5,66] and is supported by
modelling studies.[44]","note: In this case another (more specific) guideline document is used as ""evidence"" so the chain of references continues. In the next step the ref [5,66]& [44] in evidence in reference should be resolved. "
,,,,,"Recent studies confirm that G-CSF has clinical benefits for patients at 20% risk of FN. While the current guidelines have been produced in an effort to standardise and improve the quality of care for chemotherapy patients, it remains important for the reader to note that these are not designed to supercede nationally focused guidelines which are available in many cases.",note: The EORTC guideline was updated since (new version issued in 2010) this information is noted in PUBMED. The reommendation and evidence is drawn from the new guideline
,,,[293],"The 2005 Update Committee agreed unanimously that reduction in febrile neutropenia (FN) is an important clinical outcome that justifies the use f CSFs, regardless of impact on other factors, when the risk of FN is pproximately 20% and no other equally effective regimen that does not require CSFs is available. Primary prophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of FN in patients who are at high risk based on age, medical history, disease characteristics, and myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen.","However, when regimens are used that have a FN incidence of greater than 20%, CSFs have been proven to be effective and are recommended. A new meta-analysis of prophylactic CSFs in patients with solid tumor or malignant lymphoma was presented at ASCO 2005 and reviewed by the Update Committee.The study reports significant reductions in the risk of FN from 37% to 20% (14 studies, n = 3,091, relative risk reduction 46%, P<.0001) and the risk of infection-related mortality from 3.3% to 1.7% (10 studies, n = 2,468, relative risk reduction 48%, P < .01).5 Impact on overall mortality has not been reported. If this result is confirmed in the final publication, it will provide more support for the use of prophylactic CSFs in regimens with sufficient risk.",
,,,[294],"Over the past decade, costs for inpatient hospitalization have escalated, changing the risk threshold
on a pure cost basis from 40% to approximately 20%.[24] Economic analyses of CSFs have yielded mixed results, depending on the context of use.25–29 However, the policy of the NCCN Myeloid Growth Factors Panel is to look primarily at issues of therapeutic efficacy and clinical benefit, rather than cost. The indication for prophylactic CSF use depends on the risk for FN or other neutropenic events that can potentially compromise treatment.","Meta-analyses have confirmed the efficacy of
prophylactic CSFs in decreasing rates of infection,20,21
risk for neutropenia,20,21 length of hospitalization,22 and
time to neutrophil recovery.22 Clark et al.22 found a
marginal benefit of CSF in lowering infection-related
mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26–1.00;
P = .05). In a recent meta-analysis of 17 randomized
trials of prophylactic G-CSFs, including 3493 adult
patients with nonmyeloid malignancies,23 G-CSF as
primary prophylaxis reduces risk for FN (relative risk
[RR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43–0.67; P < .001) and improves
relative dose-intensity of the chemotherapy delivered
(ave rage difference between study arms, 8.4%;
P = .001). For the first time, this analysis also reports
a substantial reduction in risk for infection-related
mortality (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33–0.90; P = .018)
and all early deaths during chemotherapy (RR, 0.60;
95% CI, 0.43–0.83; P = .002).",

,,"However, because of their high expense, it is not clear that CSF prophylaxis, when given widely to patients who are at the threshold of 20% risk of fever and neutropenia, is cost-effective in all health care markets [295–297]. If societal costs are considered, the economic impact of fever and neutropenia becomes more apparent, and there may be recognition of greater cost-saving benefits of CSFs [297].",[295],"We performed a prospective economic analysis alongside a multicenter, phase III clinical trial of primary GCSF and antibiotic prophylaxis in SCLC patients at risk of chemotherapy-induced FN. Despite the selection of patients with a 24% baseline risk of FN, and despite the significant reduction of FN, the addition of GCSF did not result in cost savings. Only if one is willing to pay 3,360 euro to achieve
a 14% reduction of FN, or 240 euro for each percent gain in effect, can the addition of GCSF to primary prophylaxis with antibiotics be considered cost effective. However, the ontinued use ofGCSFbeyond the first chemotherapy cycle does not appear cost effective, even at these rates of FN.","Economic analysis was performed prospectively from a health care perspective alongside the clinical trial.6,14-16Case Report Forms were used to collect resource utilization data during the trial period, providing a patientbased cost data set. Costs were calculated for the time the patient was receiving chemotherapy in the clinical trial.Cost-Minimization Analysis
In the first cycle, the mean total costs were 2,103 euro (95% CI,
1,512 to 2,694 euro) per patient in the antibiotics group compared
with 2,783 euro (95% CI, 2,359 to 3,208 euro) in the antibiotics plus
GCSF group (Table 3). The mean difference in total cost amounted to
681 euro (95% CI, 36 to 1,397) per patient in cycle 1.
During the entire treatment period, the mean total costs per
patient were 4,564 euro (95% CI, 3,647 to 5,480 euro) compared with
9,687 euro (95% CI, 8,872 to 10,502 euro) in the antibiotics and the
antibiotics plus GCSF groups, respectively (Table 3). This resulted in
considerable extra costs per patient (mean, 5,123 euro; 95% CI, 3,908
to 6,337 euro)whenGCSFprophylaxis was added. Table 3 provides an
overview of the different cost results.",
,,,[296],"Secondary prophylaxis with antibiotics was the least expensive strategy (mean, €4,496/patient). The strategy antibiotics plus G-CSF was most expensive (mean, € 8,998/patient). Comparison of these two strategies resulted in an unacceptably high ICER (€343,110 per FN-free cycle) in the Dutch context. In scenarios using higher FN-related costs (as found in the United States), the strategies are less distinct in their monetary effects, but still favor antibiotics.","The input for the model is mainly based on the clinical outcome and patient-based cost data set (adopting the health care payer’s perspective for the Netherlands) derived from a randomized study on primary prophylaxis in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients; establishing mean cost of an episode FN of €3,290 and prophylaxis of €79 (antibiotics)   €1,616 (G-CSF) per cycle. The economic analysis was analyzed probabilistically using first- and second-order Monte Carlo
simulation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was defined as cost per FN-free cycle.",note: using monte carlo simulation is not A-II evidence
,,,[297],"As noted in the NCCN guidelines, when societal costs are considered, the economic impact of FN becomes greater, and the costsaving benefits of CSF are more apparent. The Timmer-Bonte et al economic analysis in this issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology confirms the NCCN economic assessments of CSF use.","Adding CSF to antibiotic prophylaxis increased per-patient cost in the
European setting by $650 (US) in the first cycle and $5,000 overall.
However, prophylactic regimens and reduced toxicity appear more
cost effective in the United States, where costs of each episode of
FN can be four times greater than in Europe because of markedly
greater healthcare and hospital expenditures. In addition, the
indirect costs of FN can be substantial. It is entirely possible that, in
the United States, CSF use for primary prophylaxis in the setting of
cancer chemotherapies associated with a 20% rate of FN may be
both clinically effective and cost effective.",
,,"Primary prophylaxis—the use of CSFs for prevention in the first
cycle of treatment for many solid tumors—does appear to reduce
the incidence of fever and neutropenia and is likely to be
most cost-effective. CSF prophylaxis should be especially considered
for older patients or if the presence of additional risk
factors, including prior fever and neutropenia, poor nutritional
or performance status, no antibiotic prophylaxis, comorbid
medical conditions, or other modifying disease characteristics,
suggests that there is substantial risk of fever and/or severe infection
during neutropenia [298–300]. If the risk is <10%, the
benefit is low, and CSFs are generally not recommended. If
given, CSF treatment should be started immediately after the
chemotherapy is completed.",[298],"Overall, in-hospital mortality was 9.5%. Patients without any major comorbidities had a 2.6% risk of mortality, whereas 1 major comorbidity was associated with a 10.3% and more than 1 major comorbidity with a  21.4% risk of mortality, respectively. Mean (median) length of stay was 11.5 (6) days, and the mean (median) cost was $19,110 ($8,376) per episode of FN. Patients hospitalized for  10 days (35% of all patients) accounted for 78% of overall cost. Independent major risk factors for inpatient mortality included invasive fungal infections, Gramnegative sepsis, pneumonia and other lung disease, cerebrovascular, renal, and liver disease. Main predictors for LOS  10 days included leukemia, invasive fungal infections, other types of infection, and several comorbid conditions.","The longitudinal discharge database derived from 115 US medical
centers was used to study all adult cancer patients hospitalized with FN between 1995 and 2000, comprising a total of 41,779 patients. Primary outcomes included mortality, LOS, and cost per episode.",not A-II evidence - retrospective DB analysis
,,,[299],"The risk of neutropenic fever is highly variable not only across different treatment regimens but also by different cancer types/stages, control of cancer, and different patient populations. Subsequently, multiple other risk factors have been identified [58].Advanced disease, older age, patients with prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatment have consistently been noted in multiple studies to be associated with greater risk of neutropenic fever.            Various other patient factors, such as obesity (in some but
not all studies), reduced functional status, and the presence
of comorbidities, such as diabetes influence the risk. The
patient’s physiologic status, as assessed by various parameters,
such as renal or liver function, influences the risk
for neutropenic fever. An impaired hematologic status, poor
performance status, and poor nutritional status all increase
the risk. In an attempt to systematically evaluate various
risk factors for neutropenic fever, Lyman [9], noted that the
cumulative risk for neutropenic fever increased incrementally
according the number of factors present.",,

"CSFs are not generally recommended for treatment of
established fever and neutropenia",B-II,"Myeloid CSFs are not recommended as adjuncts to antibiotics
for treating established fever and neutropenia. Although days of
neutropenia, duration of fever, and length of hospital stay have
been minimally (but statistically significantly) decreased in some
randomized studies, the actual clinical benefit of these reductions
is not convincing [301–304]. None of the studies have
demonstrated a survival benefit associated with therapeutic
CSFs. Given the cost of and adverse effects associated with
the CSFs, as well as the lack of consistent clinical data, addition
of G-CSF or GM-CSF at the onset of fever and neutropenia is
generally not advocated by the Panel.",[301]," Filgrastim treatment used with antibiotics
at the onset of febrile neutropenia in patients with cancer
who have received chemotherapy accelerated neutrophil
recovery and shortened the duration of febrile neutropenia","Of the 216 patients remaining, 109 received filgrastim and 107 received placebo. Seventeen patients in the filgrastim group and 14 patients in the placebo group were withdrawn before study completion, but all were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. Of these 31 patients, 11 died, 5 were considered treatment failures, 8 had persistent fever no longer thought to be caused by infection, 4 were removed at the patient's request, and 3 were withdrawn for technical reasons.                Filgrastim significantly reduced the median number of days of neutropenia. The filgrastim group had 1 less day with a neutrophil count of less than 0.5 X 109/L (a 25% reduction) and 2 fewer days with a neutrophil count of less than 1.0 x 109/L (a 40% reduction) (Table 2 and Figure 1). The median neutrophil count over time showed an earlier, steeper increase and a higher plateau in the filgrastim group (Figure 1). The proportion of patients with a neutrophil count of less than 1.0 X 109/L in relation to time was statistically significantly less in the filgrastim group than in the placebo group (Figure 2).","note: sort of disagreement, as they demonstrate clinical improvements, but indeed no proof of reduced mortality is given"
,,,[302],,,
,,,[303],"Adding G-CSF to antibiotic therapy shortens the duration of neutropenia, reduces the duration of antibiotic therapy and hospitalization, and decreases hospital costs in patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia.","This study demonstrates that the use of G-CSF in the treatment
of patients with solid tumors and chemotherapy-induced
high-risk febrile neutropenia significantly improves the outcome
of clinically relevant end points and is cost-effective. The addition
of G-CSF to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy resulted in a
reduction of the median duration of grade IV neutropenia (33%;
from 3 to 2 days), antibiotic treatment (17%; from 6 to 5 days),
hospital stay (29%; from 7 to 5 days), and costs (11%; from
4435 to 3960 USD). The mortality rate was similar in both
treatment arms; of interest, there was a trend toward a lower
incidence of medical complications among G-CSF-treated patients
(17% in the G-CSF group versus 10% in the control
group). Therefore, G-CSF intervention allows this patient population
to reduce safely the length of time spent in the hospital and
the number of medical interventions at a lower cost. These benefits are likely to have additional positive effects on subsequent
quality-of-life measures and socioeconomic factors.",
