# SQL scripts

These scripts were used to create the AERS database, import various tables (demo, drug, outc, reac, indi, ther) from the CSV (or $SV) data files provided on the website of the [adverse event reporting system](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm), and set empty date fields to an XSD-compliant value of '0000-00-00'.
